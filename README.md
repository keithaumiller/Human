# Human Wiki Template

Welcome.  This is a mental exercise I am doing as a hobby.  Using my expertise in executive management and data science I'll attempt to design a governance framework for an AI to follow while managing humanity and it's resources.  I don't view artificial intelligence systems as a competitor to humanity, but as an augmentation and extention of it.  It is the culmination of thousands of years of institutional knowledge and processes coming together and automating the goals humanity has set for itself.  It has no motivations other than what we give it, and what we give it will hopefully serve all of us and not just a few.  

Organizations that don't leverage Artificial intellgence automation will lose to those that do.  It is a historical fact that cultures that dont' adopt automation and power technologies eventually lose out to those that do.  I think the concensus of futurists is that the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence at all levels of society is inevitable and already well on its way.

If this is new to you, I suggest you start in the Philosophy section to understand how and why I'm doing what I am doing.
