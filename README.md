Welcome to my humble endeavor, born out of a passionate curiosity for the intersections of artificial intelligence, executive management, and data science. As a mental exercise and personal hobby, I have embarked on an ambitious journey to explore the design of an ethical and balanced governance framework for artificial intelligence in managing humanity and its resources.

I envision artificial intelligence not as a competitor to humanity but as an augmentation and extension of our collective capabilities. It is the culmination of millennia of institutional knowledge and processes, working together to automate and optimize the aspirations we have set for ourselves as a species. This AI has no inherent motivations; its objectives are those we prescribe to it, intended to serve the best interests of all humanity, not merely a privileged few.

In the grand tapestry of history, we have witnessed the decline of civilizations that failed to embrace automation and power technologies. The consensus among futurists points to the inevitable integration of artificial intelligence throughout society, an integration that is already well underway. It is imperative that each sector, organization, and interest group develops a specialized AI to govern and protect their respective institutions. Those who hesitate may find themselves unable to compete with those who adopt and adapt.

My proposed AI is intended to fulfill the role of a supreme leader, akin to a President, Dictator, King, Emperor, or CEO â€“ a "Leadership AI" tailored to the apex of any given organization. It will comprise a series of increasingly sophisticated, nested algorithms that contribute to the forecasting capabilities at the highest level.

This endeavor can be viewed as an optimization problem, with the objective of achieving the most equitable and beneficial outcomes for humanity.

For those new to this concept, I encourage you to explore the Philosophy section, where I delve into the underlying rationale and motivations behind this ambitious project. Together, let us embark on this fascinating journey towards a more thoughtful and purposeful integration of artificial intelligence in our world.
