I'll store ideas or explanation that don't fit within the architecture but may add value to eplain "Why" certain structures were picked or I've gone down a path.  

This is not a philosophical effort.  This is a scientific one, as such it requires clear metrics, measures, processes, etc to be defined.

I'm building out this documentation in the hopes that it will be leveraged at some point in the future.  

I am aware of how absurd it is to attempt to set the goal of humanity.  It is sort of like defining the meaning of life and there will be a lot of discusion and debate.

The only common goal we all seem to consistently abide by is survival.  Quality of life goals are secondary and only slightly less important.

Only by creating a model for forecasting outcomes and simulating scenarios can we get closer to our common goals.

I expect that this framework will be adapted to weight different aspects of humanity differently.  Each ethnic group or special interrest group will have their own priorities.  I intend to keep this one as neutral and fair to all interrests as possible and attempt to keep the focus on all of humanities survival, expansion, and happiness.

General strategy
1. Define clear goals
2. Define clear KPIs at the top and work backwards
3. Establish what algorithms, sensors, metrics, etc help to improve the overall forecast and which don't
4. Leverage new research as it emerges
