# [Project] Software Architecture

We plan to build the application using a Geospatial centered architectural style. We are placing humanity at the center of the objective functions.  We will attempt to tie all other branches of science towards the goals laid out by humanitarian goals.

With the help of LLMs I've started to establish a structure

Creating a new framework for organizing all scientific knowledge and research around humanitarian goals and measurement would require a radical shift in how we currently approach scientific disciplines. Here's a potential way to structure this new system:

Central Hub: At the core of this framework, we would establish a central hub that houses the primary humanitarian goals and metrics. These would be based on existing frameworks like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other widely recognized humanitarian indicators.

Spokes of Scientific Disciplines: Radiating out from this central hub would be various scientific disciplines, organized according to their relevance to the humanitarian goals and metrics. Each scientific discipline would be evaluated based on its potential to contribute to the achievement of these goals and the refinement of measurement tools.

Cross-disciplinary Collaboration: Encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration among scientists and researchers to address complex humanitarian challenges. This could be facilitated through joint research projects, conferences, and shared resources that bring together experts from diverse fields to develop innovative solutions.

Impact Evaluation: Implement a rigorous system of impact evaluation to assess the effectiveness of scientific research and innovation in advancing humanitarian goals. This would involve the development of new methodologies and metrics to measure progress and identify areas for improvement.

Continuous Adaptation: As humanitarian needs and scientific understanding evolve over time, the framework must be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances. Regular reviews and updates would ensure that the central hub remains relevant and the spokes of scientific disciplines continue to align with humanitarian priorities.

Global Accessibility and Knowledge Sharing: Ensure that this framework is accessible to researchers and institutions worldwide, with a focus on promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing across borders. This could involve the development of online platforms, open-access publications, and other initiatives to democratize access to scientific knowledge.

This new framework has the potential to transform how we approach scientific research, fostering greater collaboration and innovation to address pressing humanitarian challenges. By prioritizing impact and measurement, we can ensure that scientific progress is aligned with our collective goals for a more equitable and sustainable world.

Built based on reading and feedback from these sources:

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: The UN SDGs provide a widely recognized framework for addressing global humanitarian challenges, and served as inspiration for the central hub in my proposed framework.
Scientific Journals and Publications: Insights from research papers, journal articles, and other publications in various scientific disciplines informed the organization of scientific disciplines around humanitarian goals and measurement.

Global Research Organizations: Organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Gates Foundation, and the International Council for Science have published extensive reports and resources on cross-disciplinary collaboration and impact evaluation in scientific research.

Thought Leaders and Experts: The ideas of thought leaders and experts in the fields of science, policy, and humanitarian work, such as Ban Ki-moon, Bill Gates, and Angela Merkel, contributed to the development of this framework.

While this framework is ambitious, it is grounded in existing knowledge and best practices from around the world. By drawing on these diverse sources and engaging with experts in various fields, we can work together to develop a more comprehensive and effective approach to organizing science around humanitarian goals and measurement.  

This will give any governance intelligence a solid framework for evaluating best practices, policies, and investments.
