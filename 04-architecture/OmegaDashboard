This will be an inset dashboard with the Humanity index
It will be a scoring of success of humanity that all other research can peg to.
Not all science will feed into this index, but hopefully we can identify where most of it would fit for potential inclusion.

For the philosophy of inclusion/method of development of these forecasts please read the Philosophy section.

First round of development will be purely a population forecasting methodology

Longer term I would like to start incorporating other longitudinal models to improve overal forecasting of this index.

Sustainable Development Goals Progress: 30%
Vulnerable Population Count: 10%
Population Growth: 10%
Income Inequality: 20%
Education Levels: 15%
Health and Quality of Life Metrics: 15% - Health and quality of life metrics, such as life expectancy, access to healthcare, and overall well-being, are essential components of humanitarian success and should be given due weight in the Human metric.
