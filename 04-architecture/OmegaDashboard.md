This will be an inset dashboard with the Humanity index
It will be a scoring of success of humanity that all other research can peg to.
Not all science will feed into this index, but hopefully we can identify where most of it would fit for potential inclusion eventually.

For the philosophy of inclusion/method of development of these forecasts please read the Philosophy section.

First round of development will be purely a population forecasting methodology

Longer term I would like to start incorporating other longitudinal models to improve overal forecasting of this index.

It almost doesn't matter what the top goal and metric is, as long as every other metric has a way to feed into it in order to evaluate if it a model adds value.

Top Success Metric
Population total Over time (80)  - I like this metric because it is has high quality
Quality of life index Over time(20) - Much debate I'm sure.

1. First round will forecast out 100 years utilizing the Meta Prophet algorithtm - https://facebook.github.io/prophet
2. Second round will be a multivariate version that incoporates other features that are available as they are found to add accuracy to the top level -
