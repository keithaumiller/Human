This will be an inset dashboard with the Humanity index
It will be a scoring of success of humanity that all other research can peg to.
Not all science will feed into this index, but hopefully we can identify where most of it would fit for potential inclusion eventually.

For the philosophy of inclusion/method of development of these forecasts please read the Philosophy section.

First round of development will be purely a population forecasting methodology

Longer term I would like to start incorporating other longitudinal models to improve overal forecasting of this index.

It almost doesn't matter what the top goal and metric is, as long as every other metric has a way to feed into it in order to evaluate if it a model adds value.

Top Success Metric
Population total Over time (80)  - I like this metric because it is has high quality
Quality of life index Over time(20) - Much debate I'm sure.

Population over time https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources
1. First round will forecast out 100 years utilizing the Meta Prophet algorithtm - https://facebook.github.io/prophet
2. Second round will be a multivariate version that incoporates other features that are available as they are found to add accuracy to the top level
3. These will all need to be calculated based on an H3 geolocation function so that they can be tied to all other metrics that are also tiable to a geolocation
4. This will allow automation of all testing and incorporation of new sources of data over time.
5. If a metric is highly correlated with the ability to forecast population, it will provide a good insight on how to increase or decreate population in an area.

Quality of life index over time.  https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/standard-of-living-by-country
1. There is a lot of debate and constantly changing definitions.  Different components
