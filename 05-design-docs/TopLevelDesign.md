# Top Level Design Document

Author: Keith Aumiller

## Introduction

### Rationale

Good executive management is done via dashboards that are built to monitor and provide insight into the key metrics an organization needs to survive.  A lot of work goes into those metrics, how they are measured and  monitoried.  They use that information to make strategic decisions on how the pool of resources they have available are allocated.  It is the top of the food chain white collar job.

Artificial intelligence has a great deal of benefits for all organizations.  Automation brings speed, improved quality, overall efficiency, reduced need for expertise etc.  

AI has reached a point where anything can be automated, it is just a question of economic advantage.

I think all organizations will eventually be leveraging AI at all levels.  Including the executive level.

I am going to start laying the framework for automating any leadership role and will use management of the human race as a moonshot goal.  

Any organization that wants a personalized AI counselor for its top leadership can follow this same playbook.

### Background

Historically, automation has provided major advantages to those who adopt it, and put at a disadvantage those who have resisted it.  Better to embrace and accept than fight and avoid.  The historical examples are many, google them.

### Terminology

There is a base assumption that anybody reading this is familar with Process Improvement, automation, statistics, computer science, and business terminology.  

### Non-Goals

Everything in the universe is in scope.  Moonshot.

## Proposed Design

The world is already steamrolling forward with automated science.  Every day discovery becomes easier, insight more attainable.  
A governance system is already in place with various levels of governmental law in place worldwide.
The goal of all governming body is to improve peace and prosperity.

This design is intended to create an objective framework that all decision making can be tied to, automated, and optimized in a transparent manner by the best possible methodlogy available.

Academic science is already trying to accomplish this, but the framework is weak, has no authority, doesn't have a robust quality assurance methodology involved etc.

By formalizing KPIs, and tying all science back to the objective of humanitarian goals, we can create a more democratic contributor version of our governance frameworks.

### System Architecture

If the design consists of a collaboration between multiple large-scale components, list those components here â€” or better, include a diagram.

### Data Model

Describe how the data is stored. This could include a description of the database schema.

### Interface/API Definitions

Describe how the various components talk to each other. For example, if there are REST endpoints, describe the endpoint URL and the format of the data and parameters used.

### Business Logic

If the design requires any non-trivial algorithms or logic, describe them.

### Migration Strategy

If the design incurs non-backwards-compatible changes to an existing system, describe the process whereby entities that depend on the system are going to migrate to the new design.

## Impact

Describe the potential impacts of the design on overall performance, security, and other aspects of the system.

## Risks

If there are any risks or unknowns, list them here. Also if there is additional research to be done, mention that as well.

## Alternatives

If there are other potential solutions which were considered and rejected, list them here, as well as the reason why they were not chosen.
